I din’t have any job at some point in time, so all the time is there, to organize myself.
So, I made an excel sheet that looks like below, its sorted by “date, time, round, company, recruiter name, email, skill”
—————————
1st May, Tues, 11 am, Round 1, ABC company, name1, name1@a.com, Node.js, Angular.js
1st May, Tues,  3 pm, Round 1, XYZ company, name2, name2@a.com, Core Java, Spring boot
--
2nd May,  Wed, 11 am, Round 2, ABC company, name1, name1@a.com, Node.js, Angular.js
--
3rd May, so on
..
..
(at the end of page, repeat above, to add job description)
1st May, Tues, 11 am, Round 1, ABC company, name, name1@a.com (mailto:name1@a.com), Node.js, Angular.js
>  <add detailed job description, in bullet points given by recruiter>
—————————
Above is a good start.
—————————
Then
1. note what all is asked in interview
2. learn them all, do practicals
    1. be ready for next interview
—————————
Then more is:
* Be professional
    * Don’t cry at any point of interview - Emotional behaviour is only counted towards negative.
    * only answering interview questions correctly will only help
* 90% of interviewers are intelligent & are experts in the profession (so don’t assume otherwise)
* Be genuine. Mention your hard work always pays, collaborative nature. Trying to solve issues, before any escalation is good.
* If interviewer gave feedback without asking, note it, improve on it
* If interviewer behaved bad in interview, forgot and move on. There is another interviewer waiting.
That’s it.
