Situational Judgement Test (SJT) practice questions

1. A situation in office will be given - your 2 bosses are fighting and you have give your opinion, a lazy coworker, your team skipped you, someone is taking your job 
2. Some options will be given
3. We have to say if which is BEST & WORST option, or, we have to rate from Most effective action to tak to least effective actions to take


I have categoried below what situations (actually some words/ actions) that will be of help in choosing point #3 above.

BEST option / (Effective action) / (Most Effective)
	direct - do/ reach out/ meet/ talk / present a document/ update only mgr due to rumour
				/ put aside personal situation / fix it/ consult for ideas/ devote entirely to your work
				/ veto her participation / discuss / express concern on arrogant and disloyal to work out your differences / update mgr on discussion
				/ weigh adv & disadv to decide, no involvement in personal conflict (both mgrs)
			best to make other listen
			explain ur point behind cricism, even if discomfort, hope for best
		explain difficulty
			try to negotiate fair distribution
			put in extra hours, to make up for other
		explain issue -ve behaviour affecting her and others
			express sincere desire to help, on condition that she cooperates towards improving her attitude
		understand reasons of her decision
			already decided
				explain yours - try persuade, for a part, instead of whole (direct meet)
		talk
			explain cooperation is essential at any workplace
			belive in learning from each other
			else, more serious steps
		talk
			explain that bypassing your authority is unacceptable
		present a document
			systematically detailing pros for company, if insisted then support mgr decision
		update only mgr due to rumour - keep working normally
		consult for ideas with others to fix isuues from marketing changes
			poor performance due to unfocused -> put aside personal issues, devote self

(Slightly effective action)
	report mgmt / voice concerns with mgmt directly without direct try
				/ approve, without solving differences
		explain importance
		have concern about reflect badly on you and company, and complete by yourself your best
		try persuade the indirect benificial, for a part, instead of whole (indirect meet)

(Slightly Ineffective action)
	try & else leave to consequences / immediately report
		immediately report, for coworker replacement
		immediately report director, for coworker relocation

(Ineffective action) / (least effective)
	stay out of it
				/ let subject go this time since strained
					/ approve so that problem will relocate somewhere else
				/ let it blow over
					/ implement despite mgr resistance / go behind others back
			his right to do (but not)
			assumption - possibility of you being wrong
		leave without acting - just do your part, your best
			assumption - inflexible situation
		cut some slack
			assumption - be senstive to your employees when necessary
		let go, and wait
		implement despite mgr resistance
			assumption - faith in self work - go behind others back for benifit of company

WORST option (Counterproductive action)
	demand with furious email/ scold team members
		demand furiously to re-open, cc: executive director
		scold team members for their poor performance (actual reason: market changes)
