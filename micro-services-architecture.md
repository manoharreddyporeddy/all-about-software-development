# Micro services architecture

independent dev - in different programming languages
    increase autonomy of individual development teams - as ideas can be implemented / without having to coordinate with a wider it delivery
code is organized around business capabilities
    small pieces of functionality, so easy to understand/modify for dev - even new member can become productive quickly
    better reusability
    better efficiency
greater sales
greater mobile orders
better scalabilty
    greater operational saving - expensive to commodity hardware
        no downtime
        works well with containers
        components can spread across multiple servers
            better fault isolation - due to isoated dependencies
        complement cloud activities
greater cost saving
    less compute power
independent re/deployment
    easy integration/ continous automatic deployment
    enables continuous delivery
security problem isolation
